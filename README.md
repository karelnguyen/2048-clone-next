## Getting Started

# Useful scripts

```bash
  # test game logic
  yarn test

  # run development
  yarn dev

  # build project
  yarn build

  # generate gql schema and types
  yarn generate

  # run eslint check
  yarn eslint

  # install husky
  yarn prepare
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
